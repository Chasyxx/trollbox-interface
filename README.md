# trollbox-interface
This is a template for creating bots for the WINDOWS93 trollbox.
It's based off of my Tayo/WDICI/IDKWTCI/Protropitous bot.
It's pretty similar to trollbox-bot, except I mostly made this from scratch and it's more refined than trb.

I'm mostly making this repo for messy.
I also haven't been able to connect to the trollbox lately, so this also kind of serves as my final goodbye if that means what I think it does. o7
