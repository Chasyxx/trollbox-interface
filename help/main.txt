This is the test bot that uses trollbox-interface.
The commands are color, name, room, who, whotable, whotableascii, help, info, and status.
Anybody with the same home as the bot can run block, circuitblock, unblock, and circuitunblock.

This file should be in the help/ folder.
You can create other files (name).txt in this folder, and the help command can be used like:
help (name)
this way you can update your help pages and have multiple of them.
